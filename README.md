# Trivia Go

Trivia Go was a real world multiplayer game combining trivia and capture the flag.

You create your own map, placing waypoints and choosing trivia question categories for each. Then the people to which you give the name of the game, will be able to join and play. May the best one win !!

## Project files and instructions

In the github repository, you will find the following files and folders (non exhaustive) :

- **presentation.pdf** : our project slides to support the oral presentation of the project.

- **binaries/mobile.apk** : the android app, which you can install on any android phone/tablet

- **binaries/wear.apk** : the WearOS app, which you can install on any WearOS smart watch (using command line tools adb)

- **AndroidStudioProject** : the Android Studio project, which contains all source files. You can open this project (open settings.gradle) in Android Studio, and run/debug the Android and Wear app on any debug enabled device. 

- **extras/** : folder containing a PDF and a video presentation of the app.

This project uses Firebase Authentication and Realtime database, and the Google Maps API. As is, the project files should suffice to run and debug the app, but if not, please contact us so that we can provide the credentials to connect to those services.

## Privacy

The app doesn't store or use any data outside of the actual games. Information you input such as player names, game names, pin locations or user location during the game is never used outside the actual game. However, these elements are stored in an online database, until the game is finished. Therefore, they should be regarded as publicly accessible, albeit temporarily.
